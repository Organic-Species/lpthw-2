print("I will now count my chickens:") #Prints the string at the beginning og the program informing users of what the program will do

print("Hens", float(25 + 30 / 6)) #Prints string of word and calculates equeation based on order of operations
print("Roosters", float(100 - 25 * 3 % 4)) #Performs same actions as line 3

print("Now I will count the eggs:") #Prints a new string informaing user of next stpes in the program that will automatically take place

print(float(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)) #Calculates the following equeation

print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?") #Prints a string for the equation on line 12

print(float(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)) #Calculates equation that was stated on line 10

print("What is 3 + 2?", float(3 + 2)) #Prints string stating question with addition equation, then performs addition for the stated equation
print("What is 5 - 7?", float(5 - 7)) #Prints a string stating a subtraction equations, the performs subtraction equation

print("Oh, that's why it's False.") #Prints string statement

print("How about some more.") #Prints string statement

print("Is it greater?", float(5 > -2)) #Prints questions or greater than equation, then calculates if equation is True or False
print("Is it greater than or equal?", float(5 >= -2)) #Performs same action as line 21 but calculates with greater than or equal statements
print("Is it less than or equal?", float(5 <= -2)) #performs same action as line 22 an 21 but with less than of equal statements
